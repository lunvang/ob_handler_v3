Sattelite Data Processor Script

Description:
This script looks for L2 files that are ready to get processed, and processes them.

How-to-Use:
This script automatically finds unprocessed L2 files, processes them to L3m, and deletes the L2 and L3b raw data.
It is multithreaded, and runs multiple workers that do the actual work.
If no L2 files are available, the script will wait until they appear.
If a certain time passes without any L2 files available to be processed, the script terminates.

NOTE: Only one instance of this script may be running at a time.
